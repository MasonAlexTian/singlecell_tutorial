## BCL to FASTQ conversion
- Sample sheet
```{r sample_sheet, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.cap = 'Fig1. A sample worksheet used in sequencing in 10x Genomics Chromium platform'}
include_graphics("media/sample_sheet.png")
```

- We need to convert the Illumina sequencer's base call (BCL) files to FASTQ file format. 10x Genomics provides a software called cellranger. For instance, we can run
````markdown
cellranger mkfastq --id=${run_id} --run=${bcl_folder} --csv=${sample_worksheet_used_in_sequencing}
````
- The output generates 3 folders that includes FASTQ file folder, Reports, and Stats folders.

- Demultiplexing: In general, more than one samples are loaded into multiple flowcell and the conversion process recognizes sample barcodes and group them into a same sample.

- How the FASTQ files are look like?
After mkfastq run, sample folders defined in the input sample sheet are created and each sample folder has FASTQ files.

```{r bcl2fastq_output, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.cap = 'Fig2. Demultiplexed samples after mkfastq run'}
include_graphics("media/bcl2fastq_output.png")
```

## 10x Genomics FASTQ files

- FASTQ file format: Three files form a group. I1 contains a sample barcode, R1 contains cell-barcode and UMI, and R2 is an actual cDNA read.

```{r 10x_fastq_file, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%", fig.cap = 'Fig3. 10x Genomics FASTQ file format'}
include_graphics("media/10x_fastq.png")
```
