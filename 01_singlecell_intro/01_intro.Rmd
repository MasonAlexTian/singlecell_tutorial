## Why single-cell genomics?
```{r bulk_vs_single-cell, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%", fig.cap = 'Fig1. Single-cell RNA-seq reveals cellular heterogeneity that is masked by bulk RNA-seq methods.'}
include_graphics("media/singlecell-v.-bulk-image.png")
```
- The traditional bulk RNA-seq methods: grind and find!
- To observe the cell diversity and heterogenity
- To study the development of a sub-population of cells
- intra-tumor difference
- to characterize the immune cell population

## 10x Genomics' single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)
```{r chromium_workflow, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%", fig.cap = 'Fig2. 10x Genomics Chromium Workflow.'}
include_graphics("media/chromium_workflow.png")
```
- Scalable transcriptional profiling of 1000 to 10,000 of individual cells
- When 8,000 cells loaded with a multiple rate 3.9%, 5,000 cells to be recovered
- When 12,800 cells loaded with a multiple rate 6.1%, 8,000 cells to be recovered
